At the <a href="/2015/11/20/securitydesigworkshop.html">Security and Design Workshop</a>, we realized that our original plan of book-ending a classic digital security training with human centered design exercises was not ideal -- many elements of learning and exploration that are key to training are similarly core to collaborative design.

To test this out, we spent one afternoon running a digital security training on mobile security. We based the training on the <a href="https://www.level-up.cc/resources-for-trainers/pedagogical-resources/adult-learners">ADIDS adult-learning approach</a>, and used a selection of <a href="https://www.level-up.cc">Level Up curricula</a> components, integrating human-centered design components into the flow of the training.  The rest of this post will run through the components of the training and the outcomes from it.

The ADIDS model uses a mix of engagements to help participants learn a specific topic, 	starting with an opening Activity that introduces the topic in an engaging fashion, then Discussing the topic, then the lecture/training section ("Input"), followed by a hands-on "Deepening" - often installing and using a specific tool, and closing with a Synthesis that summarizes the entire topic and answers remainig questions. (Learn more about <a href="https://www.level-up.cc/leading-trainings/preparing-ADIDS-sessions">ADIDS at LevelUp</a>).

For the beginning Activity, we used <a href="https://www.level-up.cc/leading-trainings/training-curriculum/activity/internet">We are the Internet</a> (adapting it for mobile communications) by adding in participants (wearing tin-foil hats) as the cell towers.

The Discussion and Input sessions came from the <a href="https://www.level-up.cc/leading-trainings/training-curriculum/mobile-phones">private mobile communications</a> curricula set.

The training then shifted to a more human centered design process.  Before jumping in to working with specific tools, we added a "Design" component -- asking participants to provide the design elements they would want, as well as some participants were concerned about when making a secure mobile call (photos). 

(more here!)

We then moved into the deepening component, providing hands-on installation and practice using the <a href="https://whispersystems.org/">Signal app</a>. This separately revealed that while Signal, an app highly regarded for its usable security, still did not meet all the desired design elements from the audience (in many cases due to the differing application security frameworks across iOS and Android). This underlined that even the "best in class" digital security tools can benefit from this process.
