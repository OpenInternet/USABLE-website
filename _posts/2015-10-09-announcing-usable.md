We're very excited to announce USABLE: Usable Security Apps By Leveraging End Users! USABLE brings a human centered design lens to digital security tools through a three-phase process (detailed out below) with add-on benefits of producing community-led user personas, connecting tool developers with trainers and at-risk users, and encouraging sharing of design patterns and usability challenges along the way.

We're just getting started and are locking in our first communities, and expect to be running these needs-based trainings throughout early 2016. We will be sharing the user personas and learnings from these trainings over the next few months.

PHASE I
--------
USABLE starts by working with communities around the world with concerns about privacy and digital security because of who they are or what they do. USABLE is working with local partners on a needs assessment (based off of <a href="http://internetfreedom.secondmuse.com/needfinding/" target="_blank">Second Muses' framework</a>), and then will design a digital security training based on those needs.

This will not be a "normal" training (if indeed those even exist), as we will match-make the needs of the community with a digital security tool that addresses the security needs, and work with interested developers to send them to the training. In addition, a usability expert (we're working with ThoughtWorks, frog, and some design schools) will also attend and co-facilitate, leading some "blue sky" design work, and helping the community craft a user persona to represent their capabilities, constraints, and desires to others.

PHASE II: UXForum
-----------------
The second "phase" is really just a gathering of the trainers, UX experts, developers, key participants and others for a 4-day workshop to cross-share the experiences, identify low-hanging fruit, and put together roadmaps to address achievable usability improvements. This "UXForum" will take place in Spring or early Summer 2016. We're also planning to have a sidebar for the trainers on formalizing practices and working with developers.

PHASE III: UXFund
------------------
The final phase is funding these roadmaps to implement usability enhancements and continue engagement and user-testing with the communities (where safe) and trainers.
