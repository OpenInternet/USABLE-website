The persona generation process varied between these two TFTs.  In our first TFT, the planned process was not really gaining traction, so we pivoted to other exercises to generate full pictures of the challenges, barriers, and resources that the community had instead.  This led to very detailed discussions about risks and the innovative mitigations that they use, from planning for networks to be down to different methods to improve both digital and physical security.

We brought the most successful intervention forward to our second TFT - leveraging a comic-strip-style "day in the life" exercise to map out user journeys and identify risks, but we were also able to have the second group build their own very rich user personas; perhaps because of the improved framing of the exercise.
