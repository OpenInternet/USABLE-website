We can't believe it's been two months since the UXForum!  To be fair, we had a lot of sleep to catch up on, and there have been some exciting staff transitions over on our team.

Going forward, Megan will be leading USABLE while Jon takes on directorship of our global portfolio (including supporting USABLE!).  We are also onboarding additional program support to help out.

We've added a massive <a href="/resources">Resources page</a> that captures a ton of links and references from the UXForum, our reading lists, and more.

We also have some new <a href="/personas">User Personas</a> we've put together from the UXForum and TFT work with our communities.  These personas represent a wide variety of users of digital security tools facing a mix of threat actors.  We have created these from many common shared experiences, but for the privacy of our communities, none are 1:1 connected, and all are created from a combination of people and the work they do.  The photos are public domain or Creative Commons stock photography, and the names are of course made up.

We are working with a few teams to support UX walkthroughs, accessibility, and user testing of open source digital secutrity tools!  We will be focusing on our UXFund grantees first, but please ping us at <a href="mailto:connect@usable.tools">connect@usable.tools</a> if you are a tool developer and are interested in this -- and also check Open Technology Fund's <a href="https://www.opentech.fund/lab/usability-lab" target="_blank">Usability Lab</a> they run in partnership with <a href="https://simplysecure.org">SimplySecure</a>.
