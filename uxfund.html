<p>The UXFund supports human centered design work for open source security and privacy tools. </p>


<p>Winning applications must demonstrate a commitment to high-impact usability solutions, and incorporate human-centered design principles, including user personas and engagement of end users, such as the Tool Feedback Training participants. The majority of the UXFund will support work addressing the needs of disabled, at-risk persons and/or vulnerable populations (e.g. ethnic minorities, LGBTI, and women), but there are limited funds available for deeper tool re-architecture and/or to facilitate training to improve digital security experiences for trainees, if clear usability-enhancing outputs are presented.</p>
