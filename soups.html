									<p>This workshop will cover how to adapt UX design and user feedback collection techniques when working with high-risk communities, through an overview of the different marginalized groups and their needs that the USABLE.tools project have worked with from around the world over the past 2 years.</p>

									<p>The USABLE.tools project builds feedback loops around the globe by connecting at-risk communities with digital security trainers, usability experts, and security tool developers. USABLE has worked with over 50 trainers and engaged end users in high-risk areas, and supported open source security and privacy tools with funding as well as direct design and implementation support to take this feedback and incorporate it into their tools through human-centered design processes.</p>

									<p>Representatives from the project will discuss their methodology and outcomes from working with regional and local digital security trainers from around the world to gather feedback and build personas to represent marginalized, vulnerable, and other at-risk communities.</p>


									<h3 id="cfp">Call for Presentations</h3>
